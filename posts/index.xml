      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we will look at how we can design our own tracks and 3D print them as a low-cost and made to measure alternative to commercially available options. Tracks on a robot can help distribute the weight across a larger contact area. Along with the ability for the tracks to stretch and deform a bit, this makes the robot able to travel across both softer and rougher terrain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, we look at the process of building a Rubik&amp;rsquo;s cube solver. It uses affordable parts in combination with 3D printing and is a good beginner to intermediate project in case you want to build something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed I have been spending quite a bit of time online looking at projects done by other people. Sometimes this can give you inspiration, but it is also possible to get stuck doomscrolling. So, I decided to pick up a new project that I can build from start to finish in a few days whilst learning more about 3D modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
